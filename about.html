            <h2>About Wisp</h2>
            <p>
                Wisp is a lightweight web browser based on the <strong>NetSurf</strong> browser engine and heavily
                inspired by its philosophy of speed and efficiency. It also incorporates valuable contributions and code
                from the <strong>NeoSurf</strong> project.
            </p>

            <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
            <p>
                We are highly grateful to the developers of both <strong>NetSurf</strong> and <strong>NeoSurf</strong>.
                Without their hard work, dedication, and open-source contributions, this project would not have been
                possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Development Process</h3>
            <p>
                Wisp utilizes AI technology to enhance and modernize the original codebase. However, all AI-generated
                contributions are strictly monitored, guided, and reviewed by an experienced human developer to ensure
                quality, security, and performance.
